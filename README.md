This is a very simple way of writing and saving text documents to a computer, phone, or tablet using python.

It is built off of my "Python console save code" repository and can save text that you have written in python directly to your computer just by hitting the enter key. This works in almost all python interpreters I have tried
(including web based ones like, Pythonanywhere or jupyter notebook) so it shouldn't be and issue getting it to work.
