This is a very simple way of writing and saving text documents to a computer, phone, or tablet using python.

It is built off of my "Python console save code" repository and can save text that you have written in python directly to the 
hard-drive or SSD of your computer just by hitting enter. This works in almost all python interpreters I have tried
(including online ones like, Pythonanywhere or jupyter notebook) so it shouldn't be and issue getting it to work.
