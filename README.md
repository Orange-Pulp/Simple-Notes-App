# Simple-Note-Taker-App

This is a fun little project I had while learning how to write and append text files using python. It is a word processing and 
saving app with a main function similar to microsoft word or other word processors. Using this you can write and save text 
to your computer via a .txt file, overwrite the file, or add text. It's kinda fun to play around with and has some practical applications when automaticly recording data in realtime using python. But it's not really meant to be used day to day.
